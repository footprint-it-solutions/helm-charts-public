                        reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
                        Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
                        and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
                        The value should be a CamelCase string.
                        This field may not be empty.
